                <p id="para2">Six of Crows is a fantastic book, one of the best fantasy heist books going around. It is funny, tragic, witty, silly, murderous, thoughtful and more all in one package.Six Of Crows has a brilliant, easy to read prose that flows perfectly and is incredibly well paced. The cast of characters are all older teenagers and Bardugo perfectly manages to capture this and weave it into a much darker more complex plot.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>The multiple POV is very effective in this book, especially with each character having their own proficiences, talents, views and beliefs. We see their view on each other and on the heists, perfectly keeping you in suspense as Kaz only reveals certain elements at certain times.</p>
            </div>

            <p id="para4">The multiple pov makes the relationships and motives all the more believable by subtly fleshing out the characters and their ties, it works wonderfully to capture the true madness but desire for this heist to succeed as well as the genuine growing feelings of loyalty between the six outcasts.</p>
